# Overview

What does it mean to make an online community "better"? In this project, we seek to understand what community members value in their communities. This project consists of two parts: first, a small scale [qualitative survey](qual_survey.md) of 39 redditors, which used open-ended free text response questions to develop a taxonomy of 29 different values across 9 major categories, and second, a larger-scale [quantitative survey](quant_survey.md) which used the taxonomy from the previous survey to gather responses from 2,769 redditors across 2,151 subreddits.

We make anonymized responses from the quantitative survey public to support future research. Details and downloads for this dataset are available [here](quant_survey.md).

# Qualitiative Survey and Taxonomy

## Overview

This survey was conducted with 39 redditors who identified as members of 125 different subreddits. Each participant was asked, for each subreddit they are a member of, what aspects of the community they like, and what aspects they would like to improve upon. Using iterative categorization, these free-text responses were clustered to produce a taxonomy of 29 different values redditors have for their communities.
